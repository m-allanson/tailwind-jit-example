# About

This is my attempt at a 'bare bones' example of `@tailwind/jit`.

# Requirements

I wrote this on Node.js v14.16.0 and npm v7.6.0. Other versions probably work too.

# Getting started

Take the following steps:

- Run `npm install`
- Run either `npm run css:watch` or `npm run css:build`
- Note that the classes used in `src/index.html` have been compiled to `dist/styles.css`
